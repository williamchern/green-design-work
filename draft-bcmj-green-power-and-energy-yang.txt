1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for Power and Energy
   Monitoring and control of devices within or connected to
   communication networks, for the use cases document in
   [I-D.ietf-green-use-cases-00].

   The data model includes both the monitoring and control of Energy
   Objects for networked devices.

   This YANG data model is based on the the "GREEN framework"
   [I-D.belmq-green-framework-06], following the "GREEN terminology"
   [I-D.ietf-green-terminology-00].

   Power and Energy Monitoring and Control can be applied to devices in
   communication networks.  All identifiable devices with measurable or
   representable Power and Energy characteristics fall within the scope
   of this specification.  Target devices include (but are not limited
   to) routers, switches, Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints, smart
   PDU, storage and compute servers, etc.

   Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the components of the
   device as well as software and service running on the device.  As a
   result, the metrics to be monitored include Device Level Energy
   Efficiency (DLEE), Component Level Energy Efficiency (CLEE) and
   potential Service Level Energy Efficiency (SLEE) at the orchestrator-
   level, etc.  For example, a router can contain components such as
   Line Processing Unit (LPU), Switch Fabric Unit (SFU), Main Processing
   Unit (MPU).

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-green-terminology-00]:

   - Power
   - Energy
   - Energy Management
   - Energy Monitoring
   - Energy Control
   - Energy Efficiency/Energy Efficiency Ratio
   - Device Level Energy Efficiency (DLEE)
   - Component Level Energy Efficiency (CLEE)
   - Service Level Energy Efficiency (SLEE)

   This document makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.belmq-green-framework-06]

   - Energy Object

   The terms reused from [I-D.ietf-green-terminology-00] and
   [I-D.belmq-green-framework-06] are capitalized in this specification.

   This document uses the terms Power and Energy in accordance with
   [I-D.ietf-green-terminology-00].  Power refers to the instantaneous
   rate at which a device consumes or produces electrical energy
   (typically expressed in Watts).  Energy, by contrast, represents the
   cumulative amount of work performed over time (typically expressed in
   Joules or Watt-hours).  Both concepts are required within this YANG
   module.  Power enables real-time monitoring, control, and
   optimization of device operation, while Energy provides a time-
   integrated view necessary for accounting, reporting, and even for
   sustainability analysis.  This specification includes both Power and
   Energy attributes.

   The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in [RFC7950].
   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  The GREEN Framework

   The "GREEN framework" described in [I-D.belmq-green-framework-06]
   covers monitoring and controlling devices and components where
   monitoring includes measuring Power, Energy, demand and attributes of
   Power.

   For the whole picture of the monitoring interfaces and the relevant
   requirements, please refer to "GREEN reference model" in section 4 in
   [I-D.belmq-green-framework-06].

3.  Power and Energy Data Model

   The Power and Energy Data Model reports the Power and Energy
   consumption of each Energy Object as well as the units, sign,
   measurement accuracy, etc.  A containment tree view of the Power and
   Energy Monitoring is presented.

   module: ietf-power-and-energy

        +--rw power-entry* [object-id]
           +--rw object-id                        string
           +--ro source-component-id?             -> /hw:hardware/
                                                     component/name
           +--ro eo-power?                        int32
           +--ro eo-power-nameplate?              uint32
           +--ro eo-power-unit-multiplier?        identityref
           +--ro eo-power-data-source-accuracy?   identityref
           +--ro eo-power-power-factor?           power-factor
           +--ro eo-power-measurement-local?      boolean

4.  Relationship to the Hardware YANG Data Model

   The ietf-hardware YANG module [RFC8348] is required by the Power and
   Energy YANG module.  In the ietf-hardware YANG model, there are three
   identifiers for hardware components, which are "name", "physical-
   index" and "uuid".  Among them, "name" is the key to "List of
   components", "physical-index" matches entPhysicalIndex in the legacy
   Entity MIB [RFC6933] if it exists, and UUID is the Universally
   Unified IDentifier [RFC4122] of the component.

   In the Power and Energy YANG Module defined in this specification,
   there is a leaf named "source-component-id" which refers to the
   component name in the ietf-hardware model.  The "source-component-id"
   can in turn reuse the UUID in the ietf-hardware YANG module.

   There are also cases where the controllers also generate its own set
   of UUIDs for the hardware (components).  In such a case, it might be
   necessary to document the mappings between the UUIDs generated on the
   hardware side and the UUIDs on the controller side.  Basically, the
   devices (such as routers) generate the UUID and the controller can
   query it .

5.  Relationship to the EMAN Work

   The EMAN IETF Working Group (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/eman/
   about/) is a concluded Working Group that produces a couple of RFCs
   in the domain of Power and Energy.  The Working Group produced MIB
   modules for monitoring and control for power and energy, for the
   context information, for battery monitoring, and an extension to the
   ENITY-MIB to add the UUID definition [RFC6933].

   For various reasons, those MIB modules were not implemented by
   vendors.

   The Power and Energy data model defined in this specification use the
   Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy [RFC7460] as a
   starting point to discuss the solution to the different use cases in
   [I-D.ietf-green-use-cases-00].

   However, it has not been the goal to simply map the MIB module to a
   YANG module.  The changes compared to the EMAN MIB modules are mainly
   due to the alignment with the up-to-date requirements of the network
   carriers on Energy Efficiency.  Compared to the MIB modules, some
   definitions and types are optimized, some new Energy Objects are
   added and some legacy Energy Objects are removed accordingly.

6.  Power and Energy YANG Module

   This YANG Module is used to monitor and control Power and Energy
   usage of network devices and the components on these devices.

         "Base identity for all possible data accuracy types.
          This identity serves as the root for a hierarchy of accuracy
          types, allowing for extensibility while maintaining alignment
          with current and future industry standards.

          The hierarchy, as defined in this YANG module, is as follows.
          Other modules may extend this hierarchy with additional
          accuracy base- and sub-types as needed.

                ├── accuracy-measured-red
                │    └── accuracy-measured-red-...
                └── accuracy-measured-ones

          The accuracy levels under accuracy-measured are based on
          percent-wise accuracy classes:
             bronze:  +/- 30%
             silver:  +/- 10%
             gold:    +/- 5%
             red:     +/- 2%

          In addition, the accuracy-measured-ones identity indicates
          a power data measurement with all digits valid, except trailing
          zeros.

          Since percent-wise accuracy works poorly for very small
          values, standards such as IEC 62053, IEC 61850-7-4 and
          IEEE 1451 define accuracy classes based on a combination of
          percent-wise accuracy and absolute accuracy thresholds.
          E.g. +/-1 % of reading  +  +/-0.05 absolute units.

          Similarly, for each percent-wise accuracy class, this module
          defines a few absolute tolerance classes, indicated by
          suffixes to the accuracy identity names. The suffixes indicate
          absolute accuracy thresholds:
             no suffix:   +/-0.5  absolute units
             -1:          +/-1    absolute unit
             -10:         +/-10   absolute units
             -100:        +/-100  absolute units
             -1000:       +/-1000 absolute units
          Thus, for example, accuracy-measured-gold-10 indicates
          a power data measurement with an accuracy of either
          +/-5% or +/-10 absolute units, whichever is larger.

          For example, a power sensor reading might report a value
          of 16250, with unit multiplier of milli (10^-3), under
          accuracy-measured-gold-10. This indicates that the actual
          power value is between 16.2375 and 16.2625 Watts, since
          5% of 16.250 Watts is 0.8125 Watts, which is greater than
          the absolute threshold of 10 milli Watts (0.010 W).

          At another time, the same sensor might report a value
          of 150, with unit multiplier of milli (10^-3), under
          accuracy-measured-gold-10. This indicates that the actual
          power value is between 0.140 and 0.160 Watts, since 5% of
          0.150 Watts is only 0.0075 Watts, which is less than the
          absolute threshold of 10 milli Watts (0.010 W).";

7.  Operational Considerations

   TO BE COMPLETED

8.  Security Considerations

   This section will be completed once the YANG module is complete,
   according to https://wiki.ietf.org/group/ops/yang-security-
   guidelines.

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7.1
   of [RFC-to-be draft-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The Power and Energy YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These YANG-based
   management protocols (1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g.,
   SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and (2) have to use
   mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the YANG module "ietf-power-
   energy-monitoring".

   Note to IANA: RFC XXXX must be replaced by the newly assigned RFC
   number.
